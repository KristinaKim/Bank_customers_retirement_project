# Bank_customers_retirement_project

Problem statement
You work as a data scientist at a major bank in NYC and you have been tasked to develop a model that can predict whether a customer is able to retire or not based on  his/her features. Features are his/her age and 401K savings (retirement savings in the U.S.).

 We tried several modeling approaches to predict the result of whether a customer is able to retire.
* Performed an analysis of each variable and the relationship between them, as well as imputation analysis, discretization  analysis variable 'Age' and variables scaling analysis.
* With the help of the pipeline, we found the optimal hyperparameters and trained 8 models.
* Trained the model with various hyperparameters, metrics and found that the best model is the GaussianNB.
* The worst model is LogisticRegression with an accuracy of 91%
* Analysis showed that people over 50 years old most often retire, and their deposit is from $ 620,000.
